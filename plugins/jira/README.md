## Issue status mapping<a id="issue-status-mapping"></a>
Jira is highly customizable, different company may use different `status name` to represent whether a issue was
resolved or not, one may named it "Done" and others might named it "Finished".
In order to collect life-cycle information correctly, you'll have to map your specific status to Devlake's standard
status, Devlake supports two standard status:

 - `Resolved`: issue was ended successfully
 - `Rejected`: issue was ended by termination or cancellation

Say we were using `Done` and `Cancelled` to represent the final stage of `Story` issues, what we have to do is setting
the following `Environment Variables` before running Devlake:
```sh
#JIRA_ISSUE_<YOUR_TYPE>_STATUS_MAPPING=<STANDARD_STATUS>:<YOUR_STATUS>;...
JIRA_ISSUE_STORY_STATUS_MAPPING=Resolved:Done;Rejected:Cancelled
```

Status mapping is critical for metrics like **Lead Time**, the `leadtime`s are calculated only for those **Resolved**
issues.


## Issue type mapping<a id="issue-type-mapping"></a>
Same as status mapping, different company might use different issue type to represent their Bug/Incident/Requirement,
type mapping is for Devlake to recognize your specific setup.
Devlake supports three different standard types:

 - `Bug`
 - `Incident`
 - `Requirement`

Say we were using `Story` to represent our Requirement, what we have to do is setting the following
`Environment Variables` before running Devlake:
```sh
# JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE_MAPPING=<STANDARD_TYPE>:<YOUR_TYPE_1>,<YOUR_TYPE_2>;....
JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE_MAPPING=Requirement:Story
```

Type mapping is critical for some metrics, like **Requirement Count**, make sure to map your custom type correctly.


## Find Board Id
1. Navigate to the Jira board in the browser
2. in the URL bar, get the board id from the parameter `?rapidView=`

**Example:**
`https://<your_jira_url>/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=51`
